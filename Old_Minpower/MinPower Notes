 This is the first day of putting a lot of effort into figuring this out. On the one hand, it is fantastic that I am able to use what Adam Greenhall has build, on the other, I don't fully understand it. Working on this is bound to make me a better programmer - even if it is outdates (2013), I will learn a lot, and updating it will be very valuable for me. 

My plan is to not get bogged down in the details: understanding will come in time. 
Step 1: Set up a virtual enviroment, with all of the proper packages, and get it running!
Step 2: Increase the package reguirements as much as I can: the latest package updates will not be available for python 2.7, but thats okay. Get it to that limit and fix the problems which arise.
Step 3: Update to python 3. There are programs and scripts which do this for you, but I would prefer to do it by hand. Will by time consuming, but hopefilly informative. 
Step 4: Final update of packages, fix what comes up.

Could not figure out how config files work/getting it to run as a program. My idea now is to strip it down to the bare minimum and run as python progrm. 

Pyomo: is the library for running opitimization.

Started out by fixing a lot of print statements. 

Have been working on getting the parser to start working. 
- SafeConfigParser is no longer used, in favor of simply ConfigParser. 
- Adam originally was passing a list into parser.read, and making changes (I think to make is more robus and dlexible to user preferences), I am just putting in the direct file now, to be changed later 

Issue with a whitespace after the file name when reading in csvs... can't find where file names are specified so stripped out the spaces in the function 

df.ix is depreciated, replacing with df.loc
