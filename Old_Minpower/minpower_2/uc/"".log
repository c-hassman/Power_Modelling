2021-03-01 20:51:45 WARNING: DEPRECATED: The default domain for Param objects is 'Any'.  However,
we will be changing that default to 'Reals' in the future.  If you
really intend the domain of this Param (power_g2) to be 'Any', you can
suppress this warning by explicitly specifying 'within=Any' to the
Param constructor.  (deprecated in 5.6.9, will be removed in 6.0)
